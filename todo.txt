TODO List
=========

WRF Task:
---------

* [high] Implement functionality to update GrADS script and re-render the whole result.
* [high] for security reason, GrADS script should be created procedurally, not manually.

* [high] Make new WRF task page really works.
* [medium] AQM RPC is lacking meaningful logging.
* [medium] Implement model log viewer for each task.
* [medium] Configure error logger for the web interface.
* [medium] Implement error logger for RPC Server. Twisted logger is somewhat lacking.


AERMOD Task:
------------

* [high] Implement AERMOD Task system.
* [high] Implement point source modeling in new AERMOD task.
* [high] Implement area source modeling in new AERMOD task.
* [high] Implement meteorological data extraction from a particular WRF task.
* [high] Create result page for AERMOD task.
* [low] Download all required Hill Height data and put it in cache folder. Right now it's in master/WRF_DATA folder

-----

* [medium] upgrade certificate to use sha2 md.
* [low] removes static file listing by reconfigure Twisted server.
